	<div class="about">
		<p>I graduated from UMD back in 2012 and shortly after landed my at-the-time dream job in Baltimore, Maryland. After a couple years in that job, I decided it was time for a change and moved to Australia for the year in 2015. While abroad I worked a number of jobs but was mostly focused on traveling and running my travel blog. Working on my blog is what started my journey into coding; I had purchased a theme and couldn’t quite customize it the way I wanted to and started looking into how I could get the site to run the way I wanted. As they say the rest is history.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>As of now, I’m working as the Activities and  Co-curricular Coordinator for a charter school but hope this course will lead to a career change. In my free time I enjoy traveling, working out, trying new restaurants, cheering on the Vikes, and spending as much time as possible with my family and friends.
